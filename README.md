Hi, I'm Adina ðŸ‘‹

Glad you're here. I used to be on GitHub a lot, but this has changed. I love [forgejo-aneksajo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-aneksajo/forgejo-aneksajo) - because of its awesome features, and because it aligns with deeply held values. You can find me on several self-deployed instances, e.g., [hub.psychoinformatics.de](https://hub.psychoinformatics.de/adina).

Let's make the world a tiny bit better today. ðŸŒ±
